### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a PhD student at [Institute for Systems and Robotics (ISR-Lisbon)](https://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/projects_cat/dsor/), a research institute of [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en), Portugal. My current work results from the intersection of control, navigation and vision of multirotor vehicles. Checkout my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcelo-jacinto/) profile to see my latest work.
